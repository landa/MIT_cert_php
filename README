Written by Yafim Landa for my MIT 6.470, IAP '11 PHP Lecture given on
1/5/2010. Please feel free to improve on it. Please keep in mind that
this file was written for pedagogical reasons.

This script authenticates a user using MIT certificates. writes user
data to a database, and so it requires that a database.php file exist
that establishes a connection to a database.

I've included links to CSS, JavaScript, and favicon files so that 6.470
students wouldn't have to look up how to include these files. If you plan
to use this script for authentication, you probably want to take those out
of the <head> or replace them with your own.
