  Written by Yafim Landa for my MIT 6.470, IAP '11 PHP Lecture given on
  1/5/2010. Please feel free to improve on it. Please keep in mind that
  this file was written for pedagogical reasons.

  This script authenticates a user using MIT certificates. writes user
  data to a database, and so it requires that a database.php file exist
  that establishes a connection to a database.

  I've included links to CSS, JavaScript, and favicon files so that 6.470
  students wouldn't have to look up how to include these files. If you plan
  to use this script for authentication, you probably want to take those out
  of the <head> or replace them with your own.
